The white press sees the folly of encouraging the mob
have endangered the lives of white men
changed their tune

Lynch law appears to be on the
increase in this country and in the
negro race. In the southern states we
recall no recent instance of the lynching
of a white man. That such acts
disgrace our nation and tend to graver
consequences than many realize is
sufficiently evident. In the end society
will have order, and communities
which show incapacity to govern themselves
will he ruled with the strong
band. Lynching not only disgraces
the community in which it occurs, but
tends directly to the increase of
crime. Especially is this true when
the executioneers are of one race, and
the victims are of another. Swift and
certain punishment under the solemn
forms of the law is an effective deterrent
of crime. Death at the hands of a
mob has the opposite effect. A race
numbering millions in one country
cannot be subdued by the fear of
lynching. They can be, and in the
South are being, turned into wild
beasts, reckless of their own lives and
of the lives of others. The object of
lawful punishment is repression of
crime. The object of lynching is wild
vengeance upon some one assumed to
be guilty. Every negro in Mississippi
knows that the three persons who were
lynched on Thursday at Carrollton
met their fate, not because they were
criminals, but because they were
negroes. Had they been white they
would have been duly convicted
before punishment. We know that
the low-class negro is prone to
crimes against women. The planters
who are said to have been prominent
in the Carrollton lynching were seeking
by terrorism to secure the safety
of their families. They will never do
it by such means. On the contrary,
brutal negroes will be made more
dangerous, and those who would otherwise
be good citizens will be led to
aid and protect them. In a conflict of
races the blacks will stand by each
other, with ever-lessening regard for
law and justice. Negro crime
can never be suppressed by white men
alone. The respectable negro element
must be enlisted in the cause. And
that can never be accomplished while
negroes are lynched for crimes, for
which white men would he tried.
S. F. Chronicle.

Lynching

Some incidents in the recent
epidemics of lynchings have illustrated
with extraordinary clearness the fact,
which was already coming to be
understood, that the cause of lynching is
not the delay nor the uncertainty of
legal punishment. The mob at Pierce
City, Mo., killed two or three innocent
men and banished a large number of
others, but has not yet caught the
guilty man, who will be punished, if
at all, by the law. It was not the
uncertainty of the law that impelled the
mob, but its certainty. The law would
have singled out the guilty wretch
and punished him, but the mob was
thirsting for the blood of the innocent,
and preferred indiscriminate massacre
to discriminate punishment. Still
more clear was the case at Asheville,
Ala. Here the guilty wretch was
already convicted and sentenced to
death. The trial had been as summary
and ruthless as any improvised vigilance
committee could have provided.
The mob, in that case, could have had
no conceivable motive but contempt or
defiance of law. If two white men had
to be killed to stop that mob and save
for a few days the life of a
condemned negro, the lesson was all the
more impressive. The life of the negro
was not worth saving, and was already
forfeited, but the majesty of the
law was worth saving at any cost.

Why so many homicides?

The columns of the daily press, as
well as such statistics as have been
compiled, seem to confirm the assertion
that homicides are increasing in
this country at a percentage much
greater than that of the increase in
population. This fact furnishes a subject
for deep study on the part of our
criminologists. There seems to be no
apparent reason for such an increase
in our murder records. While we have
been insisting, in spite of the reference
often made to the good old times,
that public morals have not deteriorated,
but have steadily improved, we
are confronted by the fact of an increase
in the form moral depravity regarded
as one of the worst known to
ethics or law. To what can be ascribed
the cause of this situation?
It must be apparent to every unbiased
observer that the laxity of the
law against lynchers in the South has
had a considerable influence in promoting
homicide there. A very large
portion of the murders committed in
the United States during the last five
years have been the work of mobs.
These crimes, many of which were accomplished
by burning the victims at
the stake, are of the most brutal and
heartless character imaginable. Such
scenes, accompanied by the wild
excitement which attends them, tend
greatly to brutalize those who witness
them, and every failure to punish
those who are guilty of these crimes
encourages others to commit similar
outrages.

A national calamity the lesson it teaches

To say that President McKinley is
dead, died at the hands of an assassin,
is one of the saddest things that we
were ever called upon to chronicle.
The heads of an entire nation are
bowed in sincere and heartfelt grief
for the untimely taking off of one of
their noblest sons. A soldier, statesman,
citizen, whose public and private
life has never been assailed. In life
he enjoyed the confidence of the entire
country. His death is a personal loss
to every true American citizen. It is a
national calamity. The lesson taught
the American people is a costly one
and should not be forgotten. It shows
the fearful cost of tolerating lawlessness
under any pretext, whether it be
the cowardly anarchist, who shoots
down in cold blood his unsuspecting
innocent victim, or the brutal, heartless
mob, which murdered its victim merely
to appease their thirst for human blood.
It amounts to the same in the end the
cheapening of human life, rendering
the lives of all unsafe. The crazed
brained anarchist murders his victim,
believing it his duty and brings upon
his head the violent hands of the law
and the hatred of mankind. But the
mobs roam in thousands, killing and
burning defenseless citizens without
fear of punishment, claiming to be
our best citizens, and the fact that
our lawful authorities take no cognizance,
their murders, heartless and
brutal as they are, become popular, and
respect for law ceases to be a duty or
a virtue. This talk of down with the
anarchists will not ensure the safety of
the lives of our public men until the
mob is stamped out also. Let the American
people who have always had the
manhood and patriotism to meet every
emergency crush this species of anarchy
before it crushes them. The white
press is already trying to ignore this
national disgrace, which has been
largely instrumental in bringing upon
us our present national calamity. The
reason is obvious. If the nation is to
live, mob law must go.

The president a victim of the mob spirit

Since the cold blooded shooting of
our good president by the anarchist
Czolgosz has aroused the people as
nothing else could against anarchy and
anarchists and a demand will be made
for laws for the suppression of this
band of cold blooded murderers of innocent
people. When the people set
to work to rid the country of anarchy
no species of this dangerous disease
should be overlooked. The mobs that
have been murdering and burning
American citizens without the
slightest hindrance for the past
twelve months have done as
much to bring about the fiendish
attempt upon the president's
life as the assassin himself by setting
the law at defiance and bringing our
civilization into contempt. The anarchist
must go, whether he be a cowardly
Czolgosz or a Ben Tilman in the
federal senate. Upon this subject the
Times comments strongly as follows:
Finally, this desperate action of a
degraded man should fill us with a determination
to insist more strictly upon
the enforcement of law and order.
There has been altogether too much
laxity in this direction of late. The
liberty of which we boast is rapidly degenerating
into license. The courts
are becoming lax in their methods and
justice too frequently halts, or stumbles.
Let us have a revulsion of public
sentiment on this subject. Let a
strict line be drawn between law'breaking
and law-abiding citizens. Let
it be clearly realized that, in this
country, where the people are sovereign,
there is absolutely no excuse for
any contempt or defiance of the laws
that have been made by the people
themselves.

The negro always on the right side

It is a remarkable coincidence that
the negro has played a prominent part
on the side of the government in every
catastrophe that has befallen it
since his advent within its bounds. In
spite of the fact that the country has
never treated him with the consideration
due man; he has defended her
flag with his life whenever it has been
assailed, whether by foreign) or domestic
foes. In peace, with his muscles,
he has added to her wealth and
material welfare. In war he fought
her battles, always returning to the
pursuits of peace, only to be forgotten.
When President Lincoln was assassinated
the entire negro race was
stricken with grief. The first to attend
President Garfield, when he fell
by the assassin's bullet was Dr. Purvis,
a colored physician. Mr. Halph
Wamley, colored, was a member of
the jury that convicted Guiteau, the
assassin. It was James Parker, colored,
who felled Czolgosz after he had
fired the two fatal shots into the body
of President McKinley. He had gone
there to shake the President's hand,
just in time to fell his assassin.
Brethren, let us take courage. God
brought us to this house of bondage
in order that we might assist the
American people in working out the
great destiny of human freedom that
has been entrusted to their hands.
Faith in God, obedience to the laws,
industry, honesty and frugality will
bring us into our rightful heritage.

Phenomenal progress of the negro race

In education, religion and the accumulation of property
(special prepared for The Liberator
by Hon. Cyrus Lindell of Lincoln,
Neb.)

At the conclusion of the Civil war
the negro found himself in a peculiarly
awkward position. He found himself
an unfettered adult with the experience
of a little child, so far as the
practicable responsibilities of freedom
were concerned. Almost at the same
time the duties of citizenship were
placed upon him by constitutional
amendment. Such a precipitation of
august responsibilities upon the recently
emancipated slave, formed a nucleus
for much adverse comment by
the many who were then opposed to
him as a citizen. Indeed, when one
stops to consider this action from an
unbiased standpoint, one must admit
that there was some justifiable argument
advanced by those who opposed
such hasty action. By this action of
enfranchising the negro, there were
some results immediately manifested
in the days of reconstruction that have
had a very decided tendency to militate
against us in the south. This,
however, was far from the intention of
the good men and women who were instrumental
in giving the negro his citizenship,
for the reason that they had
in view the restoration to him of as
much as possible of the good
things of which he had been so
long deprived of by slavery, just
as soon as possible. But there
were a number of unscrupulous carpet
baggers to be considered. These
men flocked to the south and sought
to engender a hatred between the two
races in the south, and by this means
place themselves in high offices. How
well they succeeded, history tells. This
hatred did not confine itself to the
black and white races of the south, but
soon found place in the breast of the
southern white man against the so-
called 'Yankee.' Unscrupulous greed
was the cause of sowing these seeds of
discontent where the seeds of harmony
should have been sown.

The negro solves the problem

Amid this jungle of conflicting prejudice
the negro paused in his phantom-like
chase for political greatness and
realized that he had yet to fit himself
for the duties and responsibilities of
life, and qualify for the eminence of
American citizenship. The negro realized
that he needed education. With
the realization of this truth he had
found the key that would unlock the
door of prejudice and uproot the
sprouts of hatred that had been
planted. When in the early 70s this
idea of education had become generally
a set desire, there arose from the humble
log cabins of the American negroes
such a hustle, and actual activity to
accomplish their desires for culture as
have never been put forth by any people
in the history of the world. They
were the days of the Freedman's Bureau,
the old blue-back spelling book,
the spelling match; the days of the
barefooted boy and girl, with a zeal
and determination to learn something;
the days of pine-knots, that furnished
light for the little groups of poorly
clad students by night; these were the
days when God had come to lift and
guide with His own strong hand a
much neglected and persecuted people.
In a short time method and system
found a place in the conduct of the
education of the young negro. School
houses began springing up here and
there, and the negro took advantage of
every opportunity that was offered.
After the common school of the olden
time came the graded school. Then
there was a demand for higher education,
which was met by the erection
of such schools as Hampton, Fisk and
Howard universities. Today the negro
is proud of some of the best Normal
schools and colleges in America.
He has twenty-seven thousand school
teachers, one thousand lawyers, two
thousand physicians, and a host of
educated men and women fitted for
other spheres in life.

Church work

Nature has been generous in dealing
with the negro from the standpoint of
piety. He has ever been religiously inclined
and faithful to his church.
What he has done in the line of church
work is the result of persistent and
concentrated effort. His success in this
is but a sample of what he can do
along other lines. Today, out of eleven
million negroes, three million are
church members. The following is a
statement of money handled by him in
his church work for the past thirty
years:

church property owned by negroes in the U.S. $26,600,000
salaries paid preachers from 1870 to 1880 $22,500,000
salaries paid preachers from 1880 to 1890 45,000,000
salaries paid preachers from 1890 to 1901 66,000,000
maintenance of organizations 16,000,000
home and foreign missions 3,000,000
total $179,100,000

That is a large amount of money.
With such a sum of money one could
construct a railroad from ocean to
ocean, three thousand miles, at a cost
of $59,700 per mile. It is to be hoped
chat the negro will get a sufficient return
for this monster investment. It
is not out of place however, to suggest
that the trend of the negro pulpit must
be toward the proper educational qualifications.
Ignorance must leave the
negro's pulpit. You are seen by the
entire country through your churches;
then your churches must be intelligently
conducted.

Taxpayers

With but thirty-eight years of freedom,
the negro, today, pays taxes on
$325,000,000 worth of real estate. Slowly
but surely, step by step, he is beginning
to take his place among the
citizens of the country. This beginning
makes for him a per capita of
$29.50 in real estate for every black
man, woman and child in the United
States. He spends millions of dollars
foolishly every year, but experience
will soon overcome that. The negro
is a success as a citizen, the race has
progressed with more rapidity than
any other race under like circumstances
has ever advanced in the history of the
world. The young negro of today
should start in life with a fixed purpose
to succeed in some line. Let all
unite to build up our race and thereby
complete the link that will unite all
in the great brotherhood of man.
Yours for success, Cyrus Lindell.

The Afro-American Congress elects its officers

An aggravated aggregation of political highwaymen

The work done by the late Afro-American
Congress has not tended to
increase the confidence of the Afro-Americans
in the so-called league. As
a race organization it has secured for
its members no privileges or advantages
that they did not enjoy before. In
shaping the financial and political future
of the race it has had no influence
whatever. In this city, to be a member
of the league is regarded as a
detriment and no colored man who
wants a job of cleaning spittoons will
jeopardize his chances by admitting
that he is a member of the Afro-American
League. The league's endorsement
for a position debars the
unfortunate applicants' petition from
any consideration whatever. This is
due to no defect in the organization,
but to the fact that it has been used
merely for the benefit of its officers,
especially the officers of the local
league, who are generally men in
whom respectable people have no confidence.
As a result colored men who
had the interest of the race at heart
would have nothing to do with it. A
perusal of the following list of officers
recently elected will lend no inspiration
to those interested in the advancement
of race in this end of the
state: president, T.B. Morton. San
Francisco; first vice-president, S.B.
Carr, Pasadena; second vice-president,
George Russell, Bakersfield; secretary,
James Alexander, Los Angeles; assistant
secretary, F.W. Moore, Alameda;
treasurer, William Oakman, Pasadena;
state organizer, J.J. Neimore, Los Angeles;
chaplain, Rev. S.W. Hawkins,
Los Angeles. The new directorate
consist of Geo. M. Warner, Los Angeles;
William Prince, Pasadena; C.C. Flint,
Los Angeles; Rev. D.R. Jones,
Los Angeles; William Pickney, Bakersfield;
Norman Williams, Riverside;
Ed Jones, Fresno; Dudley Sebree,
Stockton; G.W. Wilson, Marysville;
J.C. River, San Francisco; C.H. Over-
ton, San Jose.
There are a number of good men
among the above list of officers, but
they are simply to be used to give the
thing a look of respectability. The
above list of officers taken as a whole
as an aggravated aggregation of political
highwaymen, among whom are men
who have no regard for the truth,
chronic deadbeats, men who do not
support their families, leaders whose
only pursuit is idleness, who set no
examples, have nothing to give but
advice, who have not the manhood to
face an honest day's labor; this, with
a so-called sin killer, is the gang who
is to do politics for what there is in it
and this in the name of the Afro-Americans
of this state. The Liberator
will camp on the trail of these six-bit
cusses, and don't you forget it.

Playing to the gallery

During Monday's session of the Afro-American
Congress a resolution was
offered endorsing a Mr. Davis of San
Francisco for a place in the commissary
department. Before the vote was
taken some old gentleman asked
whether the applicant was a republican.
Mr. Morton, to whom the question
was addressed, replied, that the
fact that he had endorsed him was the
best proof of his (Davis') republicanism,
as he (Morton) would recommend
no negro for office but a republican.
This cheap appeal to the prejudice
of the ignoramuses of the race
called forth much unfavorable comment
among the intelligent members
of the audience as to his fitness for
leadership. His friends sought to
straighten up the matter by stating
that Morton didn't mean what he said,
but was merely playing to the galleries.
Now, if Mr. Morton meant what
he said, he is too narrow and small to
lead a people who are rapidly growing
in intelligence and wealth as the negroes
are doing in this state. If he
did not mean what he said, and has a
habit of saying one thing and meaning
another, his audience will be at a
loss to know when he means what he
says, a funny position for a leader.
Playing to the galleries is the main
chance of the demagogue. The day
has passed when a difference of opinion
made negro enemies, especially in
Southern California. The intelligent,
progressive negroes of this section
make integrity, fitness and personal
worth the only requisite for the enjoyment
of their confidence. We entertain
no personal feeling against Mr.
Morton, but simply take issue with his
public utterance at a meeting said to
be held in the interest of race advancement.

Doctor M.E. Sykes

Elsewhere in this edition we are
pleased to present to our readers a
splendid cut of Dr. M.E. Sykes, one
of the leading physicians in this city.
By a thorough knowledge of his profession
and a close attention to his
business, he has built up an enormous
practice, which is by no means confined
to one race, but to the public
generally. His successful manner of
treating diseases has made him so well
and favorably known that he needs no
extended mention at our hands, but we
speak of him rather to show that there
is room at the top.

Doctor J.S. Outlaw

Doctor J.S. Outlaw, late medical examiner
of pensions of Washington, D.C.,
has permanently located in this
city. He has a neat, well-furnished
suite of rooms. Nos. 150 and 157, Wilson
block, corner Spring and First
streets. He is a graduate of the Howard
Medical college of Washington, D.C.,
and also of the Lincoln University
of Philadelphia. The doctor is a cultured,
affable gentleman, and has already
made many friends. He has a
good field and we wish him success.

Professor Booker T. Washington
has been invited to spend a day as
the guest of one of New York's famous
400, thus introducing him into the

time is not far distant when the hand
that holds the golden key, backed by
personal worth, will unlock the door
of American society, regardless of the
color of the hand.

A penny subscription

There is a very worthy movement on
foot to raise a penny subscription by
the colored people of the United States
for the benefit of Mrs. Ruth Brown
Thompson and her faithful husband,
Mr. Henry Thompson. Mrs. Thompson
is the daughter of John Brown, the liberator,
and is now 72 years old. Mr. Thompson
is 79. Mrs. Thompson's
health has been so feeble during the
past few years that the presence of her
devoted husband is continually required
by her side. Their only means
of support is a faithful daughter, whose
entire salary as teacher has been spent
to relieve their wants. Even this has
been found insufficient to meet the
many and urgent demands upon it. To
meet some of these demands their home
was mortgaged, and came very near
being sold from under them, but was
saved by the timely aid of friends. We
called upon Mr. and Mrs. Thompson on
the 9th inst., and found Mrs. Thompson
much improved in health and spirits,
but they are hard pressed. The colored
people of this state ought to raise $200
in the next thirty days for these dear
old people. We should not let them
want for anything. Let each one who
reads this send a dollar for them to

Emancipation Proclamation

The 22d of this month is the thirty-ninth
anniversary of the issuing of
the proclamation of emancipation by
President Lincoln. At the time it was
issued the country was in the throes
of civil war. It was undergoing a fearful
scourge for its inhumanity to man,
in allowing the African to be held and
sold as a chattel. It was the aim of
the administration to save the country
with slavery or put down the war
without reference to its abolition, but
the hand of God in the struggle was
seen, and after two years of disastrous
fighting and a fearful loss of
life and property with the chances of
success evenly divided between the
combatants, it became apparent to all
that the country could not be saved
unless slavery was abolished. Accordingly,
President Lincoln framed the
great document that gave Freedom to
four million slaves, saved the country
and made him immortal. Immediately
after the promulgation of that great
document the cause of the Union received
a new impetus and the tide of
battle set in against the Confederacy,
with Appomatox as its climax. The
progress made by the country in every
avenue of human achievements, since
the emancipation, has given ample
proof that freedom is the best and happiest
condition of a country, and best
stimulates the productive qualities of
its citizens. The advancement made
by the emancipated slaves has been
phenomenal and has already repaid the
country a thousand times over for its
sacrifice in securing their freedom.
While it is true, there are disturbances
here and there, caused by the hatred
engendered by slavery, the general tendency
of the country is toward a larger
freedom and a kindlier feeling between
man and man.

The negro is coming

In spite of the bitter persecution to
which the American negro is subjected
he is coming, coming all along the
line. Every year adds to his real estate
holdings. He has fourteen banking
establishments, thousands of stores
and he is to be met with in every avenue
of industry that white people will
allow him to enter. In every avenue
he enters, if left alone or if no force
is used against him, he makes a success.
His happy, contented disposition
bears him up in adversity and in
prosperity he harbors no revenge. He
is always praying to go to heaven, but
will commit no rash act to get there,
therefore, he never commits suicide.
He rarely ever tackles such high-toned
diseases as consumption. He shows a
strong tendency to avoid the charitable
institutions of the country. Although
drunkenness and crime are on the increase
in this country, they are on the
decrease among the negroes. His birth
rate is so much in excess of his death
rate that the mobs are trying to help
out the death rate. He generally
avoids divorce courts. He can live on
50 cents a day and buy a home. He
never strikes except with his. breadwinning
implements. His country will
yet be proud of him.

After Ben Tilman

The negro press and leaders have
been very severe in their criticism of
Mr. Tilman, the mob leader, who is
making a tour of the country sowing
the seeds of murder and anarchy.
When we take into consideration Mr.
Tilman's environments he needs our
charity rather than our criticism. Had
he been born in Massachusetts or
Maine he might have been a Philips
or Garrison. It is certain that he
would not be traveling over the country
advocating the' right of the strong
to murder and rob the weak. He is a
victim of circumstances the legitimate
offspring of slavery and its brutal
teaching. Being the product of the
poor white trash of the South and being
far removed from the elegant of his
race, his early training was such as did
not develop the noble qualities inherent
in the human family, but rather
baser ones. He is a living, active embodiment
of slavery's vicious teaching
and proves again that it not only cursed
both master and slave but the poor
whites even worse, for its degradation
fell heaviest upon the latter, filling
their bosoms with undying hatred for
the black race, which have fallen completely
into the hands of this class of
whites since the emancipation. The results
of the war and the advancement
made by the negroes since their emancipation
has simply increased the hatred
of the: Tilman element which is
now in the ascendency in the South,
with emissaries traveling over the North
preaching the gospel of murder, hate,
anarchy and robbery. Some time ago
one Polk Miller a member of the same
dangerous band of cold blooded murderers
made a speech before the Chautauqua
at Long Beach in which he not
only endorsed lynching with its cold
murder of defenseless women and its
burning at the stake features, but he
even charged Mrs. Harriet Beecher
Stowe with falsehood, because she contributed
so much to the overthrow of
human slavery a system that for centuries
made the women of a whole race
the, victims of the unbridled lust of
the men of another race. When we beheld
an audience of Christian workers
as they silently listened to Miller
preach the gospel of murder and hate
upon a platform erected- by them for
the purpose of proclaiming the gospel
of peace, and beheld still another audience
going wild with applause at the
announcement of Ben Tilman that he
and his gang of law breakers have decided
to set the constitution and
laws of the country at defiance and
commit murder and robbery at will,
we concluded that if we entertained
contempt for anybody in this connection
it is not for Tilman or Miller.

A mother's awful night

The murder of Mrs. Betsie McCray,
her daughter and son by a blood thirsty
mob composed of 500 white
men at Carrollton, Mississippi, on the
night of the 3rd of August was one of
the most heartless, uncalled for murders
in the annals of the South's
bloody deeds. The boxers were never
guilty of a fouler deed. For brutal
heartlessness the actions of that mob
of brave (?) white men, the proud
defenders of female virtue (?) can be
pitted against the most fiendish crimes
known to savagery. Mrs. McCray was
an industrious, well behaved colored
woman and she and family enjoyed
the confidence of all who knew them.
This being the testimony of the white
citizens of Carrollton. Every scrap of
evidence secured tended to establish
the innocence of the accused. Young
Taliaferro, son of the murdered people,
declared the prisoners innocent
and pled for their lives, but the mob
thirsted for negro blood and the fact
that the prisoners were defenseless
women aroused no sympathy for them.
To secure a confession the prisoners
were inhumanly tortured. The mother
seemed insensible to torture, and, with
a devotion possessed only by a
mother, prayed for the repose of her
dear children's souls until she was
swung into the air. The mob wanted a
confession; it would satisfy the American
people and justify their crime.
From being drawn up and down by
ropes the neck and wrists of the girl
presented the appearance of a piece
of bloody beef, but she made no confession,
having none to make. The report
sent out that she confessed was
the same old thread-bare lie always
sent to the country. Southern mobs
believe in confessions and usually
torture one from their prisoner,
whether guilty or not. Go it, gentlemen.
You are sowing to the wind only
to reap the whirlwind.

Fiends at Work

In the past thirty days five colored
men have been burned by mobs
in the South. Four were burned
at the stake with all of the
fiendish brutality characteristic of
Southern mobs. Peter Hampton an
aged colored man at Pierce City, Mo.,
charged with no crime was burned to
death in his own home by a mob of
1,000 white men armed with rifles, who
surrounded his house, set fire to it and
cremated him. The other four victims
were slowly burned, everything being
done that was possible to prolong their
lives and suffering. The torture of and
burning of Abe Wilder at Nelson ranch
near Red Ranche, Texas, was the most
shocking ever witnessed. The details
of that gruesome atrocity will never
be known. It is best. Civilized minds
could not stand it. Six thousand white
men, women and children turned out
on Sunday, August 25th, to see a negro
man burned at the stake. It was a
great treat to them. Churches and Sunday
schools were abandoned and
preachers and church members, teachers
and pupils rushed pell mell to take
part in the barbecue. According to the
methods pursued in civilized communities
neither of these victims are guilty,
as neither of them had a trial and
therefore have not been proven guilty.
The reports of confessions and proof
gathered by mobs, bent on violating
the law is not worthy of the consideration
of honest men . Men who will
burn a human being at the stake will
lie. Dear reader, would you not
hate to have a man or woman
live near you who had taken part
in burning a human being at the
stake? Could you trust such a wretch
with your children? No language can
describe the low fiendish brutality of
such human brutes.

Different ways of doing it

In the north, when a white man gets
tired of seeing his wife live he kills
her, then commits suicide or tries to
escape the gallows via the accident or
insane route. In the south, he sends
his negro man to a distant part of his
farm, murders his own wife, takes an
hour or more's ride among his neighbors.
On his return, he finds her dead,
as he left her. He calls his hired man
up and accuses him of the crime, gives
him a chance to escape, then gives
the alarm, knowing well that there
will be no. investigation. Bloodhounds
soon run the negro to the earth, the
mob which never fails to get a confession
when one is needed, burns the
negro at the stake with indescribable
torture. Justice is satisfied, and the
matter is dropped. In the north all
white women that are murdered are
murdered by white men; in the south
they are murdered by negroes, who
murder them just to get burned at the
stake. Isn't strange? In the north 99
percent of the crimes are committed
by white men, in the south all of the
crimes are committed by negroes.
Strange things, some negroes are.

Made this world too hot for him

Was the shameless manner in which
the Los Angeles Times called attention
to the burning of an American citizen
at the stake by a Tennessee mob a short
time ago. In the presence of six thousand
men, women and children the victim
passed through the fiery ordeal
without uttering a cry. The above
headline is only a sample of mob endorsement
that culminated in the dastardly
shooting of our great President.

A contemptible band of anarchists

That Milwaukee audience that applauded
Ben Tillman, when he declared
that ho and his hand of government
wreckers were going to set at defiance
the constitution and laws of the
freest, greatest government on earth,
proved themselves to be utterly unfit
for American citizenship. It was the
most contemptible band of anarchists
that ever contaminated our free air
with their poisonous breath.
The toleration of the mob by the
federal government has made the white
American citizen so lawless that our
great good president, the head of the
greatest nation on earth cannot shake
hands with the people without being
shot like a dog.

Anarchy must be stamped out. The
most dangerous anarchy that confronts
the nation today is the mob. The laws
will have to be enforced without fear
or favor, or no life will be safe. When
we set to work to banish, or hang anarchists
Ben Tilman should head the
list.

The attempt to place the blame for
the cold blooded shooting of the President
upon Mr. Hearst, is in our judgment
cowardly. The mob spirit has
been encouraged by the entire white
press of America. Read the head lines
describing mob murders and see for
yourself. We have said all along that
it would lead to a national calamity.

caused by the assassin's hellish deed.
At 11 a. m. the pastor, Rev. Donohoo,
took for his subject Our Dead
President, William McKinley; his
theme, A Great Man Has Fallen. His
text was, Know ye not that there is a
prince and a great man fallen this day
in Israel? 2 Sam. 3:38. Rev. Donohoo
spoke from his heart, setting forth in
glowing terms the greatness of President
McKinley. He first showed that
men were not born great, but they made
their own greatness. And that McKinley
was great in all that goes to make
up moral and spiritual character. He
was great intellectually. He was a
great statesman and he was a great
husband. Then he handled, He Has
Fallen, which was indeed touching to
every heart. In closing he showed how
we may, and urged upon each one, to
become great in their own sphere of
opportunities. It was a powerful sermon
and the large audience who heard
it will not soon forget it.
In the evening a memorial service
was held and the following program
was rendered: Song, That Beautiful
Land; invocation, Mr. Wm. Liester;
song, America. President McKinley's
Boyhood and Military Record, Mrs.
E. Tibbett; President McKinley in
Marriage and as Devoted Husband,
Mrs. E.G. Hill; song, Star-Spangled
Banner; President McKinley's Political
Career, Mr. F.R. Rogers; McKinley
as President, pastor; solo, I Surrender
All, Miss Maggie McCray; assassination
and Death of President McKinley,
Mrs. F.L. Donohoo; solo,
Nearer, My God, to Thee, Miss Cathrine
Wites; Miss Lennie Hardwell sung
We Shall Part, But Not Forever.
Prayer by the pastor. Mr. Frank Wiley
presided. The service was impressive
throughout. The edifice was filled to
overflowing. One young man joined the
church. Collection $20.

Mrs. Bowden has organized a literary
and social club for the elevation of the
young people. The club has an excellent
membership of young people, and
is to meet once a month at the homes
of different members. Its principal officers
are Mrs, Bowden, superintendent;
Miss Rosa McGowan, president;
Miss Vada Watson, secretary.

Pasadena entertained the Odd Fellows' convention.
The reception and collation tendered
the Odd Fellows by the Pasadena lodge
was the most brilliant affair of the
kind ever given in that city. It was a
credit to all concerned.

On with the scrap

There is an awful scrap going on
between the Western Outlook and J.
J. Neimore. If what the Outlook says
of Neimore is true he is indeed a
honey. If all reports are true how the
Eagle man can get through the towns
between here and Sacramento with
a whole skin when he goes up there to
finish his little job is a mystery. A
colored gentleman supposed to be
Neimore was roughly handled at Bakersfield
a short time ago.

Bob couldn't get lodging

There is a rumor going the rounds
that the devil refused Bob Ingersoll
lodging when he reached that winter
resort, stating that all of his best
heated rooms had been let to distinguished
church members up in the
United States. From the actions of
those American church members in
London, who left a big hotel because
their colored brethren were entertained
his satanic majesty will have to increase his space.

Northern negro outrages

A suburb of staid old Philadelphia
furnishes the latest example of mob
violence against negroes. The account
reads almost like a repetition of the
news of similar outrages in northern
states that have been reported recently.
In the case of South Camden a negro
was arrested for an offense, the nature
of which is not stated in the dispatch,
and a vengeful mob soon collected. Attacks
were made indiscriminately on
the homes of negroes, and many might
have been killed but for the timely arrival
of a strong police force.
These recent manifestations of hatred
toward the negroes in northern communities
are difficult to understand.
There is no rational justification for it.
The negroes are naturally the most
peaceful element of the population,
and there is no reasonable incentive
for such hostility against them as has
recently been reported. The only solution
of the mystery seems to be a
northward spread of the intense antipathy
that has developed in the south
within the last few years. It seems
improbable that northern people of
average intelligence should be influenced
by southern hatred. L.A. Herald.

Lyncher punished

Member of Alabama mob is sentenced
to life imprisonment
Wetumpka, Ala., Aug. 28.
Geo. Howard was today convicted of murder
in the first degree and sentenced
to life imprisonment. Howard was a
member of the mob which lynched
Robert White, a negro, in this county
some months ago.
Howard is one of the most prominent
farmers in this part of the country.
White, who was accused of shooting at
a white man, was taken from the officers
who had him in custody and was
hanged.

Colored men, let us unite in an effort
to smash all dives owned by negroes
and encourage our young men to seek
honorable employment. This is the
only way to win the confidence of respectable
people.

Elsewhere will be found the card of
Osburn and BIackstone, the well known
Pasadena shoe men. This is a reliable
firm, noted for their fair dealing, and
sell nothing but first-class shoes. Our
Pasadena readers will do themselves a
favor as well as us to give this firm a
trial.

The only thing that we are proud
of in connection with the fact that
we were born in the South is that we
left it. It is indeed hard for anyone
with a spark of human feeling in his
bosom to find anything in a section
in which to take pride where
defenseless women are hanged on the
public road and their bodies riddled
with bullets for no other reason than
that they are black. Why has Southern
chivalry fallen from its high place
into the valley of degradation and
barbarism? Where, oh, where have
all of the brave white men of the
South gone?

The refusal to allow negroes to enlist
in the First Cuban artillery shows
that the hellish American color prejudice
is paving the way for trouble in
Cuba. The United States is the smallest
great country on earth, when the
question of color is being considered.
Gentlemen, the negro is here, and you
are going to complete the work of absorbing
him that you enjoyed so well
when he was a slave.

The Odd Fellows hold a successful convention
The Odd Fellows' convention was a
successful one, every section of the
state being represented. The reports
of the various departments of the order
showed a healthy growth, and the future
of the order looks bright. The
entertainment at Elks' Hall was a
success in every particular. The program
was especially interesting and
elicited much favorable comment.
Among the excellent pieces rendered
was one by Mrs. G.M. Warner. Mr.
J. Thomas Norris, one of the popular
young men, was made one of the grand
officers for the ensuing year.

White ministers after mob waited too long

It is nearly time that men should
comprehend that human welfare is
never advanced by methods of lawless
violence.
Vain is the attempt to suppress
crime or to secure better conditions in
society through the ferocities of lynch
law. Every act of mob violence is a
lapse toward barbarism.
Every one of the recent mobs,
whether in the South or North, and
whatever the ground of the hate which
may have been behind them, helped to
make possible the crime committed on
last Friday in Buffalo.
And whoever works corruption in
public office, corporation or institution,
or overrides law, promotes anarchy.
There must be a high reign of law
or a low reign of lawlessness. Law
must be made honorable by honorable
administration of law.
Warren F. Day, D.D.,
senior pastor of the First Congregational Church.
We must stamp out these conditions
which breed anarchy as mercilessly
as we stamp out the conditions
which create the plague, the smallpox
and the yellow-fever.
Lack of proper respect for the law
and constituted authority is one of the
curses of our country and we see 'It
permeating every fiber of society. Law'
lessness is not the stock-in-trade of the
anarchist only. Anarchism is only the
worst and fiercest manifestation of it.
Rev. W.B.R, Taylor,
rector St. John's Episcopal Church.

How the president was shot

I was in the line waiting to shake
hands with the President.
This fellow (Czolgosz), when I left
the door, crowded in front of me. I was
next to a little girl, 12 years old, and
wanted to keep there, but he kept along
beside me, and crowded in. I tried to
keep him out, but at last I said, You, go on then.
The President shook hands with the
little girl, and then reached out his hand
to this fellow.
Bang, bang! went a revolver, which
the fellow had in his right hand near his
waist. He had his hat in his left hand.
When I heard the shots I grabbed him
so, throwing his forearm around the
neck of the reporter from behind by way
of illustration, and causing the subject
of his illustration to experience strangulation.
You son! You've shot
the President! I shouted.
The hold I had on his throat caused him
to throw up the hand with the revolver.
If it hadn't been for that action he would
have fired the other three shots. As
soon as his band went up, Foster grabbed
the revolver.
An artilleryman grabbed the weapon
out of Secret Service Officer Foster's hand
and drew a big knife on him. He must
have thought Foster looked like an anarchist.
He did look more like one than
the other did, because he had glasses and
a three-days' growth of beard.
Just then a big, fleshy officer struck
the man that fired the shot a heavy blow
in the face. It knocked us both down.
The murderer tried to get up, but I held
him down by that elbow clasp of his
throat. If he had got up, he would have
escaped, because the struggle was all about
Foster, who kept crying: It ain't me that
shot the President. There he is! In
spite of that he got pommeled up by the
artillerymen and the guards.

His name was Sanchez and he wanted
a marriage license, so he raised $2 and
with his bride-to-be he hunted up Sam
Kutz, the marriage, license clerk.
I am 23, she is 38. We live on Boyle
Heights,' said Sanchez, in answer to the
regulation questions.
What is your post office address?
asked Sam.
Boyle Heights, was the answer
Yes, yes; that's all right, but where
on Boyle Heights?
We live in the brush, was the remark.
Sam gave it up.
The couple hurried away to get married
before returning to their brush
home. But the wedding was celebrated
in the brush colony, where along the river
bottom and among the scrub live
many Mexicans in their little huts of
reeds and brush.

Queen's bitterest enemy

Through the death of the widow of the
murdered Conservative, Premier Canovas,
Queen Christina is relieved of the presence
of one of her most bitter foes. Indeed,
it is doubtful whether there was
anybody in Spain who hated the regent
more intensely than this proud noblewoman,
who used to be known in former
times at Madrid as the Queen of Cuba,
and who, by her reactionary influence,
exercised upon her husband and upon
his followers, was largely responsible for
Spain's loss of the Antilles, and who, the
daughter of an illustrious house, married
the elderly, the plebeian born and monstrously
ugly and squinting Canovas solely
to satisfy her ambitious craving for
power, the queen regent created her a
duchess in her own right at the time of
her husband's assassination, but received
no thanks for the honor.
